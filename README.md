# SQL-PROJECT-ANALYSIS
This analysis is the breakdown of the KULTRA MEGA STORES INVENTORY (office supplies and furnitures) dataset from 2009-2012.
This project is given to me by the DIGITAL SKILLUP AFRICA in order to access how familiar I have gotten to know my SQL and how to use it in analysing data efficiently.

## PROJECT TOPIC: KULTRA MEGA STORE REVIEW

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the KULTRA MEGA STORES. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, I seek to gain enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable me to give compelling summarization around the data analyzed and to know which category of goods is selling out more and what we can do to imorove sales and eliminate unnecessary waste of resource.

### Data Source
The primary Data source of the Data used here is kuultra mega stores inventory (case study) and this is an open source data that was shared by the DSA Facilitators.
